  title: BSUB.IO API
  description: |
    REST API for batch processing compute-intensive workloads.

    Submit jobs, upload data, and retrieve results through a simple API.
    Perfect for PDF processing, video transcoding, audio transcription, and more.

    ## Authentication

    All endpoints require Bearer token authentication using your API key:

    ```
    Authorization: Bearer <your-api-key>
    ```

    Get your API key from the [Dashboard](/).

    ## Job Lifecycle

    1. **Create** a job with `POST /v1/jobs` - Returns job ID and upload token
    2. **Upload** data with `POST /v1/upload/{jobId}` - Uses upload token
    3. **Submit** for processing with `POST /v1/jobs/{jobId}/submit`
    4. **Monitor** status with `GET /v1/jobs/{jobId}`
    5. **Retrieve** output with `GET /v1/jobs/{jobId}/output`

    ## Job States

    - `created` - Job created, awaiting data upload
    - `loaded` - Data uploaded successfully
    - `pending` - Waiting in queue for a worker
    - `claimed` - Worker claimed the job
    - `preparing` - Worker preparing to process
    - `processing` - Processing started
    - `finished` - Processing completed successfully
    - `failed` - Processing failed with error
